God bless the classroom teachers, in times like these, they try;
It’s just that all the domes and frills we shouldn’t have to buy
Johnny plays on astroturf, Susie’s got the same turf too
But if the great American dream dies, what good will that astroturf do?

Now the PHD’s from Podunk are in bureaucratic glory
Communicating, facilitating, but educating’s a different story
Can’t teach how to read and write or what is right and wrong
The Consti
Now you may go to college but don’t you be nobody’s fool,
Football domes and ivory towers ain’t what makes a school
Kids may have the best of things that tax money can buy
But if their folks can’t afford to own a home we’d better sit right down and cry.
=====
Now we’ve got some real good teachers from all across the land
They talk about how to know the truth and when to take a stand
They talk about how to think things through, do what we know is right
And not just pick the side with all the graft and the might.
=====
Now it’s time that we all started to make a few things new
Cut some wasteful spending like average folks must do
Chances are if you get mad when my short song is through,
You might have found the problem, the problem, bubba, is you.
=====
It’s too much, It’s too much
It’s too much, It’s too much
The more we pay, the less we get,
It’s too much
